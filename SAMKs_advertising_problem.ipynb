    "SAMK has budgeted up to 8000€ per week for local advertisement. The money is to be allocated among four promotional media: TV spots, newspaper ads, and two types of radio advertisements. The goal is to reach the largest possible high-potential audience through the various media. The following table presents the number of potential customers reached by making use of advertisement in each of the four media. It also provides the cost per advertisement placed and the maximum number of ads than can be purchased per week.\n",
